Annex II to that Directive lists those restricted substances. \n(3)  \nThe risks to human health and the environment arising from the use of Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), \nBis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) should be \nconsidered a priority in the periodic review of the list of restricted substances in Annex II. With a view to further \nrestrictions, the substances that were subject to previous assessments should be re-investigated. \n(4)  \nIn accordance with Article 6(1) of Directive 2011/65/EU, interested parties, including economic operators, \nrecyclers, treatment operators, environmental organisations and employee and consumer associations, have been \nconsulted and a thorough assessment has been performed. \n(5)  \nBis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and Diisobutyl \nphthalate (DIBP) are substances of very high concern (SVHC). DIBP is a substance that can be used as a substitute \nfor DBP and was subject to previous assessments performed by the Commission. The available evidence indicates \nthat those four substances, when used in EEE, can have a negative impact on recycling and on human health and \nthe environment during EEE waste management operations. \n(6)  \nSubstitutes that have less negative impacts are available for DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP in most EEE. The use of \nthose substances in EEE should therefore be restricted. DEHP, BBP and DBP are already restricted through \nentry 51 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council, (2) so \nthat toys containing DEHP, BBP or DBP in a concentration greater than 0,1 % by weight of the plasticised \nmaterial, calculated for the three phthalates cumulatively, cannot be placed on the EU market. In order to avoid \ndouble regulation, the restriction through entry 51 of Annex XVII to that Regulation shall therefore continue to \nbe the only restriction applicable to DEHP, BBP and DBP in toys. \n4.6.2015 \nL 137/10 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN     \n(1) OJ L 174, 1.7.2011, p. 88. \n(2) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, \nEvaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive \n1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council \nDirective 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (OJ L 396, 30.12.2006, p. 1).",

The longer innovation cycles for medical devices and \nmonitoring and control instruments should be taken into account while determining the transitional period. The \nrestriction of the use of DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP should therefore apply to medical devices, including in vitro \nmedical devices, and monitoring and control instruments, including industrial monitoring and control \ninstruments, from 22 July 2021. \n(8)  \nAny adaptation of Annex III or IV to Directive 2011/65/EU to exempt applications in relation to DEHP or DBP \nshould take place in a manner which, in order to avoid double regulation and unnecessary burden, ensures \ncoherence with the administration of any authorisation granted under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 in relation \nto the incorporation of those substances in EEE. Operators considering whether to apply for exemptions under \nDirective 2011/65/EU should be aware that such exemptions may cover the entire life cycle of the EEE, including \nthe manufacturing phase. \n(9)  \nDirective 2011/65/EU should therefore be amended accordingly, \nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: \nArticle 1 \nAnnex II to Directive 2011/65/EU is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Directive. \nArticle 2 \n1.\nMember States shall adopt and publish, by 31 December 2016 at the latest, the laws, regulations and adminisÂ­\ntrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the \ntext of those provisions. \nThey shall apply those provisions from 22 July 2019. \nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such \na reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be \nmade. \n2.\nMember States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they \nadopt in the field covered by this Directive. \nArticle 3 \nThis Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the \nEuropean Union. \nArticle 4 \nThis Directive is addressed to the Member States. \nDone at Brussels, 31 March 2015. \nFor the Commission \nThe President \nJean-Claude JUNCKER  \n4.6.2015 \nL 137/11 \nOfficial Journal of the European Union \nEN",
